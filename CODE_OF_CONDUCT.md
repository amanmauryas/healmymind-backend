# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Being mindful of mental health sensitivities

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Making light of mental health issues or promoting harmful stereotypes
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Mental Health Considerations

As this project deals with mental health, we have additional guidelines:

* Be sensitive when discussing mental health topics
* Avoid making assumptions about others' mental health experiences
* Do not give medical advice unless qualified to do so
* Respect privacy and confidentiality
* Use appropriate trigger warnings when discussing sensitive topics
* Direct users to professional help when appropriate

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:
* Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
* Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful
