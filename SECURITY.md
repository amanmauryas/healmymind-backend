At healmymind, we take security seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our software, please report it to us as described below. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- Primary: security@healmymindai.com
- Secondary: dev@healmymindai.com

Please include the following information:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Potential impact of the vulnerability
4. Any possible mitigations
5. Affected versions
6. Any additional information that could help us resolve the issue

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within 24 hours. You'll receive an acknowledgment of your report and regular updates about our progress.

- Initial response: Within 24 hours
- Status update: Every 48-72 hours
- Fix timeline: Depends on complexity, typically within 7-14 days

## Security Update Process

1. The security team will confirm the vulnerability and determine its impact
2. We will develop and test a fix
3. We will prepare a security advisory and release timeline
4. The fix will be deployed and a security advisory will be published

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

   - Use appropriate security headers
   - Implement proper error handling

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use JWT tokens securely
   - Implement role-based access control

3. Data Protection
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use HTTPS for data in transit
   - Implement proper backup procedures
   - Follow data retention policies

### For Deployment

1. Server Security
   - Keep systems updated
   - Use secure configurations
   - Implement proper firewalls
   - Monitor system logs
   - Regular security audits

2. Database Security
   - Use strong authentication
   - Regular backups
   - Encryption at rest
   - Network isolation

3. Application Security
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS policies
   - CSP headers
   - XSS protection

## Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures

1. Authentication
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Two-factor authentication (optional)
   - Session management

2. Authorization
   - Role-based access control
   - Permission-based access
   - API key authentication for services

3. Data Protection
   - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Secure key management
   - Regular data backups

4. Monitoring & Logging
   - Security event logging
   - Audit trails
   - Intrusion detection
   - Performance monitoring

### Security Headers

```python
SECURE_HEADERS = {
    'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
    'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
    'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
    'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
    'Content-Security-Policy': "default-src 'self'",
    'Referrer-Policy': 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin',
    'Permissions-Policy': 'geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()'
}
```
